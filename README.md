# SkiaCheck
A checkbox implementation for Xamarin.Forms made with the awesome [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) library.

## What is supported?
You can modify the entire appearance of the checkbox. You can set the checkmark color, the background / fill color and also the box color. A feature which is unfortunately missing
from the official Xamarin.Forms checkbox. 
Other than that you can also define the width of the outline and of course you can bind easily to the IsChecked property.

For a sample just take a look at the [MainPage.xaml](https://github.com/LegendaryB/SkiaCheck/blob/master/src/SampleApp/SampleApp/MainPage.xaml) file located in the SampleApp folder.

### Platform support
Currently the Android and iOS platform is supported. I don't plan to support UWP. But I would accept PR including it.

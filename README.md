# SkiaCheck
A checkbox implementation for use in Xamarin.Forms made possible by the awesome [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) library.

## How can I use it?
Just take a look at the [MainPage.xaml](https://github.com/LegendaryB/SkiaCheck/blob/master/src/SampleApp/SampleApp/MainPage.xaml) of the sample app.

## Platform support
Currently the Android and iOS platform is supported. I don't plan to support UWP. But I would accept PR including it.
